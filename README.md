# SmartColourPicker
Colour palettes are a set of thoughtfully chosen and arranged colours to produce
a pleasing and aesthetically pleasing design. Palettes are valuable tools
for designers, artists, and professionals. They help to effectively communicate
emotions, convey messages, and establish visual identities.
SmartColourPicker is a program that makes it easier for users to compare
and create colour palettes. It uses advanced colour analysis and creation capabilities,
as well as image processing algorithms and clever colour extraction
techniques, to accurately extract colours from images.
Users can choose from a preloaded sample library or upload their own
image. SmartColourPicker considers factors like colour quantization, clustering,
and dominant colour extraction to analyze the image and extract
the primary colours. This ensures accurate colour analysis while removing
extraneous colour information or noise.
